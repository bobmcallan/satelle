description: Project-scope solo-dev workflow authored in DOT. Stories move backlog → plan → in_progress → integration → release → done (with cancelled exit). Reviewer-first: a reviewer gates every transition. Plan dispatches to an isolated read-only planner; in_progress, integration, and release run in-loop on the driving session (executor). Integration entry runs a local suite check (example: make integration); release close requires a changelog entry for the released version. Always-on estimate gates begin-work and close.

# satelle workflow (project) — the agent model, authored in DOT

> **This is a project workflow** under `.satelle/workflows`, the ACTIVE workflow
> for the adopting repo: a project-scope workflow takes precedence over the binary's
> embedded **system** default `satelle-baseline-workflow`. See the
> `satelle-repo-agnostic` and `satelle-agent-model` principles.

The lifecycle is the **DOT graph** below — read it as the authority; this prose
only orients and must not restate it. Each node is a step carrying an `agent`.
This workflow is **reviewer-first** (a reviewer gates every transition). **Plan**
dispatches to an isolated read-only `planner`; **in_progress**, **integration**,
and **release** run **in-loop** on the driving session (`agent=executor`) so the
session performs the work with its normal context, principles, and tools — not a
fresh isolated worker subprocess. The driving session orchestrates transitions,
performs the executor stages, and lets the gates judge.

`plan` stays on its own read-only binding because it is entered from the
non-performing `backlog` state, and the dispatch lock-guard refuses a code-writer
dispatched from a non-performing state. A **reviewer** node only gates *entry*
via its `prompt="@skill:NAME"` (read-only — it judges, never mutates). Status
advances only through a reviewer's accept. The gating begins at intake:
`backlog -> plan` is gated by `satelle-story-intent-review`. A reject leaves the
story at `backlog` to be fixed and re-requested (or cancelled via
`backlog -> cancelled`).

Two things the edges don't show. **There is no deploy state** — pushing to `main`
IS the release, verified by CI. And the **always-on gates are declared, not
injected**: the edge-less reviewer nodes `estimate` (`on="in_progress,done"`) and
`intcheck` (`on="release"`) run on the transitions their `on=` names, so the DOT is
the sole gating authority. `estimate` requires a plan estimate entering
`in_progress` and an actual entering `done`; `intcheck` runs `make integration  # example: your local integration suite command` on
entry to `release` (the `integration -> release` edge), alongside that edge's
`satelle-integration-review` — so `integration` is a **visible testing step**, not a
gate hidden inside another transition (<story-id>). The `integration -> in_progress`
and `release -> in_progress` edges are recovery: a reject returns the story to work
to fix and re-traverse, never bypass.

## Skill resolution

Every gate/skill this workflow names resolves through the doc-index, **project
scope (`.satelle/skills`) layered over the embedded system defaults**. The
dispatched `plan` (`@skill:plan`), and the in-loop `in_progress` (`@skill:code`),
`integration` (`@skill:integrate`) and `release` (`@skill:release`) rubrics, and
the reviewer gates (`satelle-story-intent-review`, `satelle-story-plan-review`,
`satelle-code-ac-review`, `satelle-integration-review`, `satelle-integration-check`,
`satelle-story-release-review`, `satelle-estimate-actual-review`,
`satelle-story-cancel-review`, `satelle-step-summary`), and the post-release
lessons capture (`satelle-lessons`, dispatched on enter-done via the
`[retrospective]` binding) are authored in the adopting repo's `.satelle/skills` — so
there is no dangling `@skill:` reference and a story drives to a terminal state
without a missing-skill block. `satelle-workflow-change-review` (CSV sibling on
`in_progress → integration`) resolves from the **embedded** substrate (not
repo-authored). Reviewer gates degrade to advisory only if their rubric is
genuinely absent. Lessons are offline corpus (not session-injected).

## Environment

```yaml
guardrails:
  always:
    - Drive an engaged item to a terminal state (done or cancelled) — don't leave work open indefinitely.
    - Give a story numbered acceptance criteria before starting, and satisfy them before moving to done.
    - Dispatch only the plan stage to the isolated planner; perform in_progress, integration, and release in-loop as the driving session (agent=executor); let reviewer gates judge every transition.
    - Bump the version + commit + push + record the release in the in-loop release step; the release gate verifies the bump, CI, the published release, and the acceptance criteria before close.
  ask_first: []
  never:
    - Place any state after done — done is always the terminal success state.
    - Self-enact a gated edge the reviewer has not accepted.
    - Mark an item done with unmet acceptance criteria, or release with a failing CI run.
    - Re-dispatch in_progress / integration / release to an isolated worker when this workflow assigns them to the executor — those stages stay in-session.
```
