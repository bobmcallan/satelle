#!/bin/sh
# credguard.sh -- run a command and fail if it changed the operator's host
# credentials file in a way a test could have (sty_18403814, sty_5ba68e2c).
#
# Usage: credguard.sh -- <cmd> [args...]
#
# The file is ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/satelle/credentials.toml, the
# per-user store `satelle login` writes. A test suite must leave it untouched.
# The guard compares the file's IDENTITY before and after the command, not its
# bytes: a satelle process outside the suite may refresh a hosted token during
# the run, which rewrites tokens and timestamps but keeps every credential's
# server_url, display_name, email and principal_id. That passes. Adding or
# removing a credential, changing an identity, creating the file from absent,
# deleting it, or leaving it unparseable exits 1 with a message.
#
# The fingerprint and diff are hosted.CaptureIdentity / hosted.DiffIdentity (via
# scripts/credfp), the same code the integration suite's host-surface guard
# uses, so the two guards agree. When the command itself fails, its exit status
# is kept, so a red suite stays red and the guard only adds a failure of its own.
# If the helper cannot be built or run the guard fails closed (exit 2).
