# Workflows — how a story's lifecycle is chosen

A **workflow** is a story's lifecycle: the steps it moves through and the
reviewers that gate entry to each. satelle does not hardcode a lifecycle — the
operator authors it as substrate under `.satelle/workflows`, and satelle enforces
it.

The authored form is a **derived route**: two files, `done.md` and `step.md`.
`satelle help workflow-convert` is the key-by-key reference (and the guide for
converting a repo that still carries a retired DOT graph).

## The two halves

**`done.md` — what DONE means.** One `## <category>` section per story category,
each an ordered list of obligations, plus the exits the binary synthesises. `## *`
governs any category with no section of its own.

```
## *
- raised
- coded
- closed
park: blocked @satelle-story-blocked-review
cancel: cancelled @satelle-story-cancel-review
+ surface:ui design-reviewed
```

**`step.md` — what discharges each obligation.** One `## <name>` section per
step, one `## gate <skill>` per always-on gate.

```
## in_progress
agent: executor
skills: code
reviewers: satelle-story-plan-review, satelle-story-architecture-review
reviewer_agent: reviewer
parallel: 0
provides: coded
requires: raised
```

Both files carry ordinary frontmatter (`name`, `type: workflow`, `scope`,
`description`) and **must not** carry `applies_to` — done.md's sections are the
selector, and a second one would be a second precedence rule. A lifecycle hook
(`hooks:` / the `create_review:` shorthand) rides on **done.md**.

**The binary owns topology.** Order is a topological sort of `requires` /
`provides`; cancel from every non-terminal step, park from anywhere, backward
movement and park → cancel are all synthesised. Authoring a `cancelled` or
`blocked` step by hand is the most common conversion mistake.

## Precedence

A repo's own route governs the categories its `done.md` claims. The route the
binary SHIPS is order zero: it governs a category only when no authored workflow
claims it, so upgrading the binary never re-routes a repo behind its back.

```
satelle workflow list --category <category>
```

The head of that list is the active choice. A workflows doc that declares no
route governs nothing: satelle REFUSES transitions under it, naming
`satelle help workflow-convert`, rather than falling back and silently dropping
every gate the repo authored.

## The choice is stamped

At create, the governing lifecycle is **stamped** on the story — a
`workflow:<name>` tag plus a `workflow_stamped` ledger entry — so the trail
records what governed. With a derived route the stamp is `done.md+step.md` for
every category; which LANE applies is chosen by the story's category, and
`satelle story restamp` re-resolves it after a re-categorisation.

## Avoiding misconfiguration

`satelle workflow validate` flags what the operator should fix:

- **An unresolved reviewer skill** — a step or gate names a reviewer that does
  not resolve in the substrate. WARN, not FAIL, on the named form: a repo
  mid-authoring writes its route before its gate skills.
- **An unresolved executor rubric** — a step's `skills:` that does not resolve.
  That IS a hard failure: the step cannot be performed, so the story can never
  reach its terminal state.

That command also prints each gate's **effective model** (the binding's model, or
the CLI default when the binding pins none). `satelle agent validate` prints the
same surface under its grant listing. To review one gate on a different model,
define a second `role = "reviewer"` binding in `.satelle/workflows/agents.toml` and name it
as that step's `reviewer_agent:` — see `satelle help agent-dispatch` and the
`satelle-route-standard` principle.

## Binding a reviewer: a step's `reviewers:` vs an always-on `## gate`

How a reviewer is **bound** matters as much as which skill it runs.

### A step's `reviewers:` — gate-specific reviewers (prefer this)

A gate belongs to the step it ADMITS. Bind a gate-specific reviewer to that
step:

```
## integration
reviewers: satelle-code-ac-review
reviewer_agent: reviewer
```

- **List order = execution order** (and ledger order). By default reviewers run
  **sequentially**, **all-must-accept**, with **first-reject short-circuit**
  (later reviewers are not invoked once one rejects) — but only when the step
  says so with `parallel: 0`.
- **Concurrency is the default for 2+ reviewers.** Unset `parallel` runs the
  list concurrently with no short-circuit, so a rejected round spends tokens on
  every reviewer. Set `parallel: 0` for sequential, or `parallel: N` (cap 4) to
  bound the fan-out. Aggregation stays all-must-accept in the binary; a
  multi-reject refusal names every rejecting reviewer.

### An always-on `## gate` — multi-step only

A `## gate <skill>` section with `on:` is an always-on gate for every entry into
the steps it names:

```
## gate satelle-estimate-actual-review
on: in_progress, done
for: *

## gate satelle-step-summary
agent: reviewer
mandatory: true
for: *
```

Use it **only** when the gate genuinely belongs on every entry into those steps
(estimate at begin-work and close; step summaries). Authoring a gate-specific
check as a single-step `## gate` is the common misuse.

`for:` names the categories whose route the gate belongs to. In a shared
catalogue, omitting it fires the gate on every lane — including ones with no
release to verify.

### The over-fire trap

A gate on one step matches **every** transition into it, including recovery
(`integration → in_progress`). The gate then re-fires on every fix-loop
re-entry — an extra reviewer invocation per rework cycle. Bind it to the step's
own `reviewers:` instead unless always-on is what you mean.

See the embedded `satelle-workflow-change-review` gate for a content judgment of
route edits; structural validate stays PASS/FAIL only.

## Four things a lifecycle governs — don't confuse them

They differ in WHERE they are declared, WHEN they fire, and WHO decides:

| | Declared in | Fires | Decided by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step gates** | a step's `reviewers:`, or a `## gate` section | on a status change | a reviewer skill's verdict (or a coded ```check) |
| **Lifecycle hooks** | done.md frontmatter (`hooks:` / the `create_review:` shorthand) | outside the status graph — at story creation today | a reviewer skill's verdict |
| **Deterministic structure checks** | nowhere — they are the binary's contract | always, before anything else | code (`internal/structure`); no LLM, never flaky |
| **Agent judgments** | a reviewer skill's rubric | wherever a gate or hook names it | an isolated agent returning accept/reject |

**Step gates** are the status graph. They can only judge a move from one state to
another, so anything off the graph is out of their reach.

**Lifecycle hooks** exist for exactly that gap. Story creation has no `from`
state — the item does not exist yet — so it cannot be a transition. A hook
declares the operation, the skill that judges it, and the logical agent that runs
the skill:

```yaml
hooks:
  - operation: create_review
    skill: my-create-review
    agent: strict-reviewer     # optional; defaults to reviewer
```

The scalar `create_review: my-create-review` is the documented shorthand for the
same thing with the default agent. A hook declares **who** runs a skill, never
**how**: model, effort, command, transport and tool grant stay in
`.satelle/workflows/agents.toml`. `satelle workflow show done` prints each hook's full
resolved allocation; `satelle agent validate` refuses one whose agent is missing,
is not `role = "reviewer"`, or is `command = "in-loop"`.

**Deterministic structure checks** are not configuration at all — a story needs a
clear goal and at least one numbered acceptance criterion, judged by code so the
result is harness-independent and identical every run. A structural failure
pre-empts: no hook or gate reviewer is reached on a malformed draft.

**Agent judgments** are the rubrics themselves. A gate or hook says *which* skill
judges; the skill says *what* the judgment is. That split is why adding a
criterion is a markdown edit rather than a release.

## Beyond validate: the semantic review

`workflow validate` is deterministic structure only. The judgment it deliberately
does not make — is each performing step's `agent:` allocation (and its binding's
model) deliberate; does each performing step have a reviewer on the step that
follows it; is a dispatched binding's grant scoped to its step; is a dispatched
implementation step self-sufficient (an isolated agent sees only the item and its
rubric, never the conversation); is each gate bound where it belongs — is the
**agent's** review, guided by the embedded `satelle-workflow-advisor` skill
(`satelle doc get skills satelle-workflow-advisor`). Its findings are ADVICE to
the operator; the coded structural check stays the only hard rule.

For the full contract a dispatched (`agent: <name>`) step runs under — how it is
briefed, how it pulls the story/documents/ledger by id, what makes it
self-sufficient, and why the step that follows it must carry the review — see
`satelle help agent-dispatch`.

## Reading a story's route — `satelle story route <id>`

The two halves answer "what is the lifecycle". They do **not** answer "what is
THIS story's lifecycle" — which tag-scoped gates are on for it, where it is now,
and why each gate it has already passed decided as it did.

`satelle story route <id>` is that answer, as one artifact:

- the **plan half** — the ordered steps between the story and done, each with the
  obligation it discharges, who performs it under which rubrics, and the
  reviewers gating entry, marked when a gate is present only because the story
  carries a tag (and marked `skipped` when it is absent for want of one);
- the **outcome half** — appended as each step resolves: every reviewer's
  verdict, its reasoning, and a pointer to the full output on the ledger.

They are deliberately the **same document**. A route read separately from the
verdicts is two things that drift.

The route renders live before a story has moved, so it is answerable from
backlog, and it never requires opening a workflow file. That matters because the
graph is no longer authored: there is no diagram to read, and refusals carry the
same weight — an engine refusal names the **rule** that fired, why it fired on
this story, and the legal moves it leaves open.
