# Named-agent dispatch — how an isolated step receives its instructions

A workflow node can allocate a step to a **named agent** instead of the in-loop
session. When a state carries `agent=<name>` (any name other than `executor` or
`reviewer`), satelle **dispatches** that step: it spawns the agent CLI configured
in `.satelle/agents.toml` under `[<name>]`, hands it the work, and folds the
result back in. The agent runs with a **fresh context** — it never sees the
conversation — so the contract below is how it learns what to do and how it gets
the rest of the story.

## The dispatch contract

Dispatch fires **on entry** to the state, after that state's entry gate accepts.
The agent receives:

- **System prompt**, assembled in this order:
  1. the session-resident principles (unless the binding sets
     `inject_principles = false`; default on),
  2. an **executor charter** — you are performing this step of this workflow;
     do the step's work, but **never change the item's status** (the workflow's
     gates govern every advance),
  3. the **pull-context call-to-action** (see below),
  4. the node's `@skill:<name>` **rubric** — the instructions for the step.
- **stdin**: the work item as JSON — `{story, from, to, review_skill}`. `story`
  carries the id, title, body, and acceptance criteria; `from`/`to` are the
  transition being performed.
- **Capabilities**: exactly the binding's `tools` and `model` grant, nothing
  more.

**Refusals (fail loud, never silent):**

- A node names `agent=<name>` but `.satelle/agents.toml` defines no `[<name>]`
  binding → the transition is **refused** (there is no silent in-loop fallback).
- A binding's `tools` grant does not include the read-only satelle CLI
  (`Bash(satelle:*)`, or a broad `Bash` / `*`) → the dispatch is **refused**,
  because the agent could not pull its context (below).
- A binding whose harness is `in-loop` keeps the step with the orchestrating
  session — not dispatched.

The agent's output is captured to the executor log (and, for a task execution, a
run-output document), so an isolated step's work stays reviewable.

## The pull contract — reconstruct context by id, don't wait to be told

Because a dispatched agent starts fresh, satelle does **not** cram documents or
history into the payload. The payload is a **handle** — the item and its id — and
the agent **pulls** everything else itself, by id, with the read-only satelle CLI:

- `satelle story get <id>` — the full current record.
- `satelle story docs <id>`, then `satelle story doc <id> <name>` — the attached
  documents: the implementation **plan** and every prior **step summary** (each
  gated transition deposits one), which narrate the work so far.
- `satelle ledger list --story <id>` — the evidence ledger (transitions, review
  verdicts, summaries).

A read-only reviewer whose grant excludes Bash reads the same attachments on disk
under `.satelle/stories/<id>/` (tasks under `.satelle/tasks/<id>/`). Either way:
**fetch before concluding a document or a prior step is missing.** This is why a
dispatched binding must grant the satelle CLI — it is the agent's context channel.

## What makes a step safe to dispatch (sufficiency)

- **Give the node a rubric.** A dispatched node needs `prompt="@skill:<name>"`.
  A rubric-less dispatched node (`agent=<name>` with no `@skill:`) receives only
  the charter and the item — rarely enough to perform a real step.
- **Make the item self-sufficient.** An isolated agent never sees the
  conversation, so the story's body, acceptance criteria, and attached docs must
  **stand alone**. Anything the step needs that lives only in the chat is lost.
  The plan and step-summary documents (pulled by id) are the sanctioned channel
  for carrying context forward — not the conversation.

## Gate/dispatch sequencing — judge the EXIT edge

Dispatch fires **on entry to the target state, after the entry gate accepts** —
so a dispatched step's work must be judged by its **exit edge's** gates. An
entry-gated state followed by an ungated commit/push ships the dispatched agent's
mutations **unjudged**. When you allocate a step to a named agent, make sure the
edge *out* of that state carries the review that vets what the agent did.

## Custom agents — a worked example

To add a custom agent (say an `architect` that runs on a stronger model), you
define it as a **binding** and **allocate a step to it** — both in satelle's own
substrate, never in a harness's agent directory.

1. **Define the binding** in `.satelle/agents.toml`:

   ```toml
   [architect]
   harness = "claude -p --append-system-prompt {system} --allowedTools {tools} --model {model}"
   tools   = "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(satelle:*)"   # read-only + the pull-context CLI
   model   = "opus"                              # per-step model selection is the model key
   ```

2. **Allocate a workflow node** to it in the DOT:

   ```dot
   design [agent=architect, prompt="@skill:architect"]
   ```

3. **satelle dispatches it** on entry to `design`: the item on stdin, the
   `architect` rubric (+ charter + pull-context call-to-action) as the system
   prompt, the binding's tools/model as the grant — on whatever CLI the harness
   names.

**Anti-pattern:** defining that agent in a harness-specific agent directory (e.g.
`.claude/agents/architect.md`) works *for that one harness*, but hides the process
configuration from satelle — it cannot see, validate, dispatch, or carry it
repo-agnostically, and it silently pins the repo to one CLI vendor. Keep process
agents in `.satelle/agents.toml` + the workflow DOT.

## Mixing model backends — per-binding env + `${VAR}` (sty_001558ce)

`model` selects the model *within* the harness's CLI; to point one step at a
*different backend* (a non-default API), a binding may also set **`env`** —
environment variables layered onto that dispatched agent's process, binding keys
winning. Each value may reference the **`[vars]` KV** via `${NAME}`, resolved at
load; an unknown `${VAR}` refuses the command (naming the binding + var) rather
than dispatching with a blank credential. `${...}` appears only in env values, so
it never collides with the `{system}/{tools}/{model}` argv placeholders.

Put the KV in `[vars]`: NON-secret values may sit in the committed `satelle.toml`;
**secrets go in the gitignored `satelle.local.toml`**, whose keys win per-key. The
KV is file-only (no DB) and `satelle.local.toml` is excluded from the substrate
push, so a key never leaves the machine.

Worked example — run one step on **GLM** through z.ai's Anthropic-compatible
endpoint (the *same* `claude` CLI, no wrapper binary), while the in-loop session
stays on its own model:

```toml
# .satelle/agents.toml
[planner]
harness = "claude -p --append-system-prompt {system} --allowedTools {tools} --model {model}"
tools   = "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(satelle:*)"
model   = "glm-4.6"   # the model id the endpoint expects (glm-5.2 is the newest)
env     = { ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic", ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN = "${GLM_API_KEY}" }
```
```toml
# satelle.local.toml  (gitignored — never commit the key)
[vars]
GLM_API_KEY = "sk-…"
```

Keep the **committed default** on your always-available backend so a clone with no
key still runs; make the alternate backend an **opt-in** the operator switches on.
An exit gate that re-judges the step (e.g. `plan → in_progress`) on the default
backend keeps a weak alternate-model output from reaching the build.
