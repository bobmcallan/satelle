# satelle doctor — is satelle ready to govern this repository?

`satelle doctor` is the one diagnostic surface. It answers a single question for
the current repository — and, with `--all`, for every registered one.

It **composes** the checks that already own their rules rather than adding rules
of its own. That is deliberate: `satelle init`, `satelle doctor`, and the
engagement precondition must never form three different opinions about the same
repo, and the only way to guarantee that is for them to run the same code. A
rule that lived only in doctor could not be changed without a binary release,
which is exactly what the constitution forbids.

## What it checks

| Area | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Every binding's command, transport, timeout, and `${VAR}` resolution | the agents layer check |
| Machine-wide profile references — missing profile, reference cycle, role conflict | profile resolution |
| Workflow node/edge allocations, and lifecycle-hook allocations | the agents layer check |
| Reviewer permission ceilings | the agents layer check |
| Workflow / skill / principle / task structure | the authored-substrate contracts |
| Cross-workflow consistency — ambiguous `applies_to`, unresolved skills | the workflow consistency check |
| Required binaries — each isolated binding's executable is on PATH | doctor |
| Harness hook scaffolding vs this binary's canonical wrappers | the scaffold check |

## Two configuration layers, deliberately kept apart

Doctor names both, because confusing them is the mistake it exists to prevent:

- **Repo workflow POLICY** — `.satelle/`: workflows, gates, lifecycle hooks, and
  which logical agent runs each step. What *this repo* enforces. Never
  machine-wide.
- **Machine-wide EXECUTION** — `~/.satelle/agents.toml`: reusable provider
  profiles (command, transport, model, effort, tools). *How* a command runs on
  this machine, shared by every repo that explicitly references one.

For each binding, doctor prints the **effective value and its source**:

```
GRANT [reviewer] role=reviewer interface=command backend=isolated:claude read-only
  source: command = "claude -p …" (profile:claude-opus)
  source: effort = "low" (repo)
  source: model = "opus" (profile:claude-opus)
  source: tools = "Read,Grep,Glob" (embedded)
```

The four sources are `repo` (inline in `.satelle/agents.toml`),
`profile:<name>` (an explicitly referenced machine-wide profile),
`global-role:<name>` (the catalog's opt-in `[roles]` default), and `embedded`
(satelle's compiled fallback).

## Secrets

Environment **values are never printed**, in any mode, including `--json`.
Doctor lists each binding's env **key names** with whether the value resolved:

```
Environment keys (names only — values are never printed):
  [planner] ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (resolved), ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (resolved)
```

An unresolved `${VAR}` is a finding that names the **key**, never its contents.

## Severity

| | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **FAIL** | an error — the repo is not ready, and engagement will refuse for the same reason, with the same identifier |
| **WARN** | advisory — printed, never blocking. Used where the underlying test is a heuristic and a false positive would strand a working repo |
| **INFO** | context you asked for (a live probe that answered) |

Every finding carries a **stable identifier** (`binary.missing`,
`agents.profile.broken`, `hook.alloc.unresolved`, …). The identifier is the
contract: the same defect reports the same id whether you meet it in `doctor`,
in `satelle init`, or in an engagement refusal — so it can be scripted against.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | healthy — warnings are allowed and still printed |
| `1` | one or more error findings, in any checked repository |
| `2` | doctor itself could not run (bad flag, unreadable global config) |

## `--all` — every registered repository

```bash
satelle doctor --all
```

Each registered repo is checked **independently**. An unreadable, uninitialised,
or pathological repo becomes its own one-finding report rather than aborting the
sweep — a diagnostic that stops at the first bad repo is useless to an operator
with several. Output ends with `N healthy, M unhealthy`, and the exit code is the
worst result across all of them.

`satelle service status` prints the same healthy/unhealthy tally for registered
repos, so an unhealthy repo is visible from the service surface rather than
looking identical to a ready one.

## `--live` — opt-in provider probes

**Ordinary `satelle doctor` performs no paid and no network model call at all.**

`--live` additionally starts each isolated binding's CLI:

- a **command**-transport binding is asked for its `--version`;
- an **ACP** binding is taken through a single `initialize` handshake.

Neither opens a session nor sends a prompt, so **neither is a paid model call** —
but both spawn provider processes and may consume provider authentication and
rate budget. That is the side effect to be aware of before wiring `--live` into
anything automated.

Every probe is bounded by `--timeout` (default 20s) and its process group is
killed and reaped on the deadline or on cancellation, so a probe never leaves a
provider process behind. Authentication is diagnosed only where the provider
**says so** — an unexplained failure is reported as a spawn failure, not guessed
at as an auth problem.

Live findings are advisory: a provider that is down does not make a
well-configured repository unhealthy.

## Machine-readable output

```bash
satelle doctor --all --json
```

```json
{
  "repos": [{"repo": "…", "ok": false, "findings": [
    {"id": "binary.missing", "severity": "error", "title": "Missing executable",
     "detail": "…", "remediation": "…", "artifact": "reviewer"}
  ]}],
  "summary": {"healthy": 2, "unhealthy": 1},
  "exit_code": 1
}
```

Ids and severities are stable; env values never appear.
