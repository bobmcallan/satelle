description: Functional-check for substrate close — rejects non-lane paths in the story change set (recorded + live with substrate leg + commits naming it), including uncommitted worktree paths; rejects empty sets. Deterministic, self-contained; managed footprint and edit_exempt_paths allowed.

# Substrate-only check (substrate workflow close gate)

**Functional-check** gate on the substrate workflow's close. The workflow
DECLARES it as a scoped reviewer node (`on="done"`); on `in_progress → done` it
verifies the story's **change set** touched **only** substrate-lane paths:

markdown and config under `.satelle/` (workflows, skills, principles,
documents, tasks, agents.toml, hooks, …), `docs/`, the binary's own **managed
footprint** outside `.satelle/` (the root `.gitignore` managed block and harness
hook scaffolds under `.claude/` and `.grok/` that `satelle init` deploys), or any
prefix in `[gate] edit_exempt_paths` in `satelle.toml`.

Any other path (a `.go` file, `cmd/`, build/CI config) — whether committed or
sitting uncommitted in the working tree — means the change is **not**
substrate-only and belongs on the project workflow — the close is **rejected**.
An **empty** change set (nothing recorded, nothing since engagement, no commit
naming the story — including an empty commit alone) is also **rejected**: empty
is not evidence of a substrate-only change.

Why the managed footprint rides this lane: those files are binary-emitted,
binary-managed **process configuration**, not product code.

## Evidence channels (union — no commit required)

The slice is the **union** of:

1. **Recorded** — `satelle story diff <id> --recorded` (change_record rows)
2. **Live + substrate** — `satelle story diff <id> --include-substrate` (git
   worktree since engagement plus mtime-changed substrate under authored dirs
   and the data dir — so git-ignored `.satelle/` is visible)
3. **Commits** — any commit whose message mentions the story id

A repo whose `.satelle/` is git-ignored (hosted `[sync] personal` continuity)
closes with **no commit at all** when the live/substrate channel shows only
lane paths. Where the repo tracks substrate in git, commit+push remains the
usual practice but is not a gate precondition.

The check is the embedded ```check script below — **self-contained**, no
external file (see [[satelle-reviewer-self-contained]]). Exit 0 accepts;
non-zero rejects with notes. **Mechanism, not judgment.** See
[[satelle-agent-model]].
