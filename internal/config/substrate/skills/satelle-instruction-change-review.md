description: Judges a change that adds or rewrites instruction text in a skill, principle or the constitution against three tests — it helps accurate, readable code; it is about satelle and this project; it does not duplicate or pad context already injected. Rejects naming the failing passage. Review-only; edits nothing.

# Instruction-change review

You are an isolated, **read-only** reviewer. You receive `{story, from, to}` on
stdin. The instructions this story added or rewrote are in the payload `diff`
(files, patch) — skills, principles and the constitution, embedded default or
project substrate. Instruction text is paid for on every call an agent makes
and shapes the code it writes, so judge only the **added or rewritten** text.
Do not modify anything.

Run only when the change is more than a typo or whitespace fix; that trigger is
the gate's configuration, not your call. If the payload carries no such change,
accept with notes `instructions: n/a`.

## The three tests

1. **Supports accurate, readable code.** Each instruction is correct against
   the code and workflow as they stand, is unambiguous, and steers an agent
   toward code a reader can follow. Reject a claim you can show false (read the
   tree), a rule that contradicts another, or one an agent cannot act on.
2. **About satelle and this project.** The text says something specific to how
   satelle or this repo works. Reject generic advice any agent already follows
   ("write clean code", "handle errors"), and one repo's process placed in an
   embedded default every other repo inherits.
3. **Neither duplicates nor pads.** Compare against what is already injected:
   the always-resident principles and constitution in the payload (or under
   `.satelle/`), and the skill's own remaining text. Reject a passage that
   restates one of them, repeats itself, or adds words without adding a rule.
   A pointer (`[[name]]`) beats a copy.

## Judging

Fair gate: judge what changed, not the whole file. A rewrite that shortens
text while keeping every rule passes test 3 even if the file is still long.

- **Accept** when every added or rewritten passage passes all three tests.
- **Reject** with one note per failing passage: quote it, name the test it
  fails (1, 2 or 3), and say the fix (delete it, point at the existing text,
  correct it, or make it specific). Never reject for style alone.
