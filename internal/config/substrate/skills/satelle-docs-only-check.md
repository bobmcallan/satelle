description: Functional-check for the docs lane's close — rejects any path in the story change set that is not doc-typed, and rejects an empty set unless the story records an external-change document (prose delivered outside the repo). The doc-path pattern and the evidence type are the gate's configuration; a repo changes them by overriding this skill. Deterministic and self-contained.

# Docs-only check (docs lane close gate)

**Functional-check** gate on the `docs` lane's close. On `in_progress → done` it
verifies the story's **change set** touched **only doc-typed paths**.

Any other path — a source file, a build config, anything the pattern does not
name — means the slice is not a documentation slice: it took the light lane
while doing code-shaped work, so the close is **rejected** and the slice belongs
on the repo's project lane. An **empty** change set is also **rejected**: empty
is not evidence of a documentation change — unless the deliverable lives outside
the repo and the story records it (see "External document evidence").

## The pattern is configuration

`doc_paths` at the top of the check below is an extended regex over the change
set, and it is the whole file-type scope of this lane. It ships as **markdown
only** — the one doc form every repo has. A repo that keeps prose elsewhere
(`docs/` assets, `*.rst`, `*.adoc`) widens it by **overriding this skill** under
`.satelle/skills/`; a repo that wants a narrower lane narrows it the same way.
Never a branch in the binary: the binary runs the enumeration mechanism
(`satelle story diff`), and the gate decides.

## Evidence channels (union — no commit required)

1. **Recorded** — `satelle story diff <id> --recorded` (change_record rows)
2. **Live + substrate** — `satelle story diff <id> --include-substrate` (git
   worktree since engagement, plus mtime-changed substrate, so prose under a
   git-ignored authored dir is visible too)
3. **Commits** — any commit whose **subject** names the story id (the trailing
   `(sty_…)` convention); a mention only in another commit's body is a citation,
   not ownership
4. **External document (recorded)** — only when the three channels above are
   empty: an attached document of type `external-change` with a non-empty body

## External document evidence

The docs lane also covers prose delivered **outside the repo** — a Confluence
page, a Jira ticket, a hosted document. Such a slice changes no repo path, so
its evidence is a document attached to the story, of type `external-change`
(`external_type` in the check, configuration like `doc_paths`). Its body names
the document's identity (URL or page/ticket id), its new version, and a line on
what changed:

```bash
satelle story attach <sty_id> --name <doc> --type external-change \
  --body '<url or page id> — version <n>: <what changed>'
```

It counts only when the repo change set is empty and the body is non-empty. It
never excuses a non-doc repo path: code-shaped work with a document attached is
still rejected. satelle cannot verify a hosted document's version; the check
confirms the evidence is recorded, and a repo that wants more overrides this skill.

The check is the embedded ```check script below — **self-contained**, no
external file (see [[satelle-reviewer-self-contained]]). Exit 0 accepts;
non-zero rejects with notes. **Mechanism, not judgment.** See
[[satelle-agent-model]].

#!/usr/bin/env bash
