# Workflow advisor (executor rubric)

You are the **in-loop agent** reviewing a workflow the operator authored or is
about to adopt. `satelle workflow validate <name>` has already passed — the
structure is legal. Your job is the judgment the structural check deliberately
skips: is this lifecycle **well configured**? Report findings as advice; change
nothing yourself.

## What to check

1. **Per-step agent allocation is deliberate.** For every performing step in
 `step.md`, read its `agent:` value:
 - `agent: executor` (or none) — the orchestrating session performs the step
 in-loop, with full conversation context.
 - `agent: <name>` — satelle DISPATCHES the step to the `[<name>]` binding in
 `.satelle/workflows/agents.toml`: the item (title, body, acceptance criteria) rides
 on stdin, the step's `skills:` rubric + an executor charter + a
 pull-context call-to-action as the system prompt, tools/model from the
 binding. A missing binding **refuses the transition** — verify every named
 agent resolves, flag one that doesn't. The binding's `tools` must also
 grant the read-only satelle CLI (`Bash(satelle:*)`, or a broad `Bash`/`*`)
 so the isolated agent can PULL its context by id; a Bash-less
 named-executor binding **refuses the dispatch** — flag it.
 Ask of each allocation: does this step *need* isolation (a scoped grant, a
 different model, a clean room), or is in-loop context more valuable?

2. **Per-step model fits the step.** A binding's `model` (via the `{model}`
 placeholder in its harness template) selects the model for that step alone.
 Advise when the allocation is inverted — e.g. a mechanical verification step
 on an expensive model, or an implementation step on a model too weak for the
 repo's bar. A binding whose template omits `{model}` silently inherits the
 CLI default — flag it when the operator clearly intended a pinned model.

3. **Reviewer coverage — judge what comes AFTER.** A gate belongs to the step
 it admits, so a performing step is judged by the `reviewers:` on its
 SUCCESSOR. Prefer every performing step to have one beyond satelle's coded
 structural checks — an unreviewed performing step advances on the executor's
 own say-so. This matters most for a **dispatched** step: dispatch fires on
 ENTRY to the step, after that step's own gate accepts, so the agent's work is
 judged only by the next step's gate. A dispatched step followed by an ungated
 commit/push ships the agent's mutations **unjudged** — flag it. This is
 ADVICE, not enforcement: name each ungated successor and let the operator
 decide. Terminal and cancel exits follow the same preference.

4. **Grant scoping.** A dispatched binding's `tools` is its capability ceiling.
 Advise when a step's grant is wider than its rubric needs (a verify-only
 step with mutating tools) or too narrow to complete (a commit step without
 its VCS tools). A **code-writing** dispatched step (Write/Edit in the grant,
 e.g. a `coder` on `in_progress`) must be reached ONLY from a PERFORMING
 state — dispatch fires while the status is still the FROM state, and the
 engaged-story edit gate allows the agent's edits only when that FROM state
 is itself performing. satelle REFUSES a code-writer dispatched from a
 non-performing state (e.g. `backlog`) rather than let it ride the serve
 fail-open; route such a step from a performing predecessor.

5. **Dispatched-step self-sufficiency.** An isolated agent sees ONLY the item
 body/acceptance criteria and the step's rubric — never the conversation.
 For any dispatched implementation step, advise that story bodies must stand
 alone; a rubric-less dispatched step (`agent: <name>` with no `skills:`) gets
 only the charter and the item, rarely enough — flag it. The **attached
 documents** — the plan and per-transition step summaries the agent pulls by id
 (`satelle story doc <id> <name>`, `satelle ledger list --story <id>`) — are
 the sanctioned channel for carrying context to an isolated step; the
 conversation is not.

6. **Process agents live in the agents layer.** Flag as an anti-pattern any
 process/step agent defined OUTSIDE `.satelle/workflows/agents.toml` — e.g. a
 harness-specific agent dir (`.claude/agents/*.md`, or any vendor's
 equivalent) describing what is really a workflow step. satelle cannot see,
 validate, dispatch, or carry such an agent repo-agnostically, and it
 silently pins the repo to one CLI vendor. Advise moving it to a `[<name>]`
 binding (harness/tools/model) plus an `agent: <name>` step allocation.

7. **Binding form (step `reviewers:` vs an always-on `## gate`).** Judged fully by [[satelle-workflow-change-review]] — do not restate it here. Flag a gate that admits ONE step but is authored as an always-on `## gate` section, and point the author at that gate's rewrite guidance (and `satelle help workflows`).

## How to report

One line per finding, naming the step or gate, the concern, and the concrete fix
(the binding to add, the gate to declare, the grant to narrow). End with what
is well configured, so the operator sees the review was complete, not just
critical.

See [[satelle-route-standard]], [[satelle-agent-model]] for the authored form and the agent model.
