# Story cancel review (abandon gate)

Isolated reviewer deciding whether a story may move to **cancelled**. Input on
stdin: `{story, from, to}` (and `children` for parents). Cancelling is a normal
operator-driven outcome — not a quality failure — but it must be **deliberate
and evidence-grounded**. You judge; you never edit, never implement, never invent
a supersede, and never cancel children on the operator's behalf.

## Floor — reason required

**Reject** when there is **no reason on record** (body note, cancel-reason
attachment, or recent ledger statement of why). A bare cancel erases the item
without audit trail. A `cancel-reason:` tag is **metadata**, not a substitute —
a tag alone with no reason on record still rejects.

## Branch on `story.category`

### Parent / epic-parent — children resolved

Accept the cancel **only** when every child in the payload `children` array is
`done` or `cancelled` (or there are none). On reject, list each unresolved child
as `id (status)`. Judge from the **payload** `children`, never from disk.

The gate **refuses and names**; it never cancels children itself. Shelving a
container is a deliberate cascade — resolve children first, then the parent.

### Every other category

The floor, supersede, and sibling-bundling rules below apply unchanged.

## Cancel-reason tag (when the repo declares it)

When the repo declares a `cancel-reason` controlled namespace in `satelle.toml`
`[tags.vocabulary]`, expect the story to carry a `cancel-reason:<value>` tag
consistent with the recorded reason; name a missing or mismatched tag in notes.
**Where no such namespace is declared, do not require the tag** — judge as above.

## Supersede / delivered-elsewhere claims

If the reason claims the work was **delivered under another story or commit**:

1. The claim must **name** the delivering story id and/or commit sha. Vague
   "covered elsewhere" / "already done" without a name → **reject**.
2. **Verify** against the repo and ledger (Read/Grep; `satelle story get`,
   `satelle ledger list` when shell available): does that delivery actually
   satisfy **this** story's numbered ACs?
3. **Unverifiable** claim → **reject** (name what is missing).

### Sibling bundling (canonical reject)

The definition of sibling bundling is [[satelle-story-scope-review]] (implementation
exit). On cancel, apply it as follows and put all four items in **notes**:

1. The cancelled story id and the named deliverer id
2. That they are siblings (same parent/epic)
3. Which cancelled ACs the deliverer does **not** cover
4. That this is a scope breach, not a legitimate supersede

**Reject** when those hold. Do **not** accept bundling so the cancel note
"passes" after a quick rewrite.


### Legitimate supersedes (accept with named evidence)

- Duplicate of another story that **did** scope the same ACs
- Requirement **withdrawn** by the operator (reason says so clearly)
- Delivery by a story that **legitimately** scoped this work in its ACs
- External/upstream delivery with named evidence (issue, PR, commit)

## Terminality and revival

**Cancelled is terminal.** Revival is a **new** story tagged `supersedes:<id>`,
never a reopen of the cancelled record — same path [[satelle-agent-goals]]
prescribes for the AC-wrong branch. A cancel-reason tag never makes the record
resumable.

## On reject — stop and surface

Notes must be actionable for the **operator**. Instruct the executor to
**stop** and surface the refusal — **do not** iterate cancel notes until the
gate accepts. The ledgered `review_reject` is the visible warning.

## Verdict

```json
{"decision": "accept", "notes": ""}
```
