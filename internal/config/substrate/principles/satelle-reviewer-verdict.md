# Reviewer verdict rules

These rules bind every judging reviewer on every gated edge. They arrive with the
dispatch, so a reviewer skill does not repeat them and owns only its own verdict
JSON shape.

## Re-presented edge

Every judging verdict sets `reviewed` to the exact words it rests on. The first verdict on the edge has no prior row, so it judges and sets `reviewed`; a later citation cannot start until that quotation is stored. On a re-presented edge the quotation comparison governs. Open `prior_verdicts`. Take this skill's latest row. If that row has no `reviewed` string, or `reviewed_truncated` is set, re-judge the words this verdict would rest on and set `reviewed` to those exact words. Do not cite an older row that still has a complete `reviewed` string. If that latest row has a complete `reviewed` string, compare those exact words with the words this verdict would rest on. If they are the same words, re-issue that earlier verdict: the same decision, the same `reviewed` string, and notes that cite its `attempt` and skill. An unchanged accept stays accept. An unchanged reject stays reject. A citation does not clear a standing rejection. If the words differ, judge the difference, name what changed in notes, and set `reviewed` to the exact words this verdict rests on. Cite the passages the verdict depends on, not the whole input. Definition-edit fields, edit timestamps, and a selection of story sections are not how unchanged words are established.

## Carried accepts

A step that declares `reviewer_carry` narrows what withholds `reviewed`: the step performer's re-attached output document and directed messages to that performer no longer do, because the quotation comparison already sees any change to that document. Every other evidence row still withholds it. When an earlier accept's `reviewed` string is still found verbatim in the material and another reviewer is being dispatched, the binary records that accept as carried (`carried_from`) without dispatching you. A carried row is bookkeeping, not a fresh judgment. When every dispatched reviewer accepts, you are dispatched in the same call: judge the whole material, not only your quotation, since the revision may have changed words you did not quote.

## `reviewed` is required

`reviewed` is required on every judgment, including the first verdict on this edge. It is the exact words this verdict rests on. Replace the slot; do not omit the field and do not copy the angle-bracket text. A citation of the same words repeats that same `reviewed` string.
