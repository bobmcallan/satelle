// `satelle hook context` — the SessionStart always-context injector

//
// At session start it fetches every `principles:session`-flagged authored doc
// and injects their bodies as session context, followed by the standing "pull
// the rest on demand" instruction. This keeps the minimal SYSTEM residency set
// in front of the agent without auto-injecting an unbounded list — the bodies
// are bounded by a byte ceiling, and an overflow is reported on stderr (never

// injects nothing and never blocks the session.
//
// Residency taxonomy (sty_1278fdd9 / satelle-residency): ONE classifier —
//
//	system   = carries the principles:session tag → injected every session
//	ondemand = no marker (default) → pulled only when a skill/workflow references it
//
// Frontmatter scope: on principles is NOT an injection axis (removed; inert if reintroduced).
// Ownership (embedded_sha) is orthogonal to residency.

		Long: `gate is the PreToolUse handler for Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|
search_replace|write. It returns a deny unless a story is ENGAGED — in one of the
active workflow's non-terminal engaging states. On deny it
emits one harness-correct JSON shape on stdout, named by --harness or detected
from the event envelope: Claude hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision=deny;
Grok decision=deny + reason; cursor permission=deny + user_message +
agent_message. The encodings live in internal/agentcli. Emitting two shapes in
one blob fails Claude's schema and silently unblocks the tool.
"Engaged" is authored substrate: it reads the route's start/terminal markers
(Mdiamond=start, Msquare=terminal), never hardcoded state names.

The installed satelle-hook.sh wrapper passes a deny it recognises through
unchanged, exit 0; any other result becomes that harness's infrastructure deny.
commitgate fails open for non-mutating shell.

The edit target is resolved to an ABSOLUTE path against the repo root before any
containment test: Claude sends an absolute path, Grok a relative one.

Edits landing in ANOTHER git working tree are REFUSED — open a
session in THAT repo. Temp, scratchpad and non-repo paths are allowed.

Exemption is CONFIGURATION, not code. An edit is exempt when its target falls
under a [gate] edit_exempt_paths prefix (repo-root-relative or absolute) or
matches an edit_exempt_globs filename pattern. 'satelle init' SEEDS .satelle/,
the footprint it deploys (.gitignore, harness scaffolds) and story-dump names;
the operator owns the lists. With empty lists even a .satelle/ edit needs an
engaged story.

Exemption stops at a performing story. While a story holds a
performing seat, an edit under a [gate] lock_substrate_paths prefix (default
.satelle/ when the key is absent) is REFUSED before the exemption is consulted,
so a story cannot rewrite the workflows, skills and bindings that judge it.
One harness-neutral predicate decides it for Claude, Grok and pi. The deny names
the seat-holding story, the path and the lane out — a substrate-lane story
(category "substrate", judged by satelle-workflow-change-review) may change
substrate under its own seat — and lands on that story's ledger. Never locked:
temp dirs, edit_exempt_globs matches, and the deployed footprint (.gitignore,
.claude/, .grok/, .pi/). lock_substrate_paths = [] opts out; 'satelle doctor' reports it.

The lock covers Bash too, here and in 'hook commitgate', with the same text and
ledger row: a redirect, tee, rm/mv/cp/sed -i or git -C target in locked
substrate, or an interpreter command (python, node, perl, ruby, sh/bash/zsh -c)
whose arguments, heredoc or NAME=value assignment name a locked path or the bare
