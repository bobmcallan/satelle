new binary (release dogfood). systemctl --user calls are run with the systemd
user-session env defaulted (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR / DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS), so a
headless / non-login agent shell with a running user manager still succeeds.

When the user bus is genuinely unreachable (no running user manager), the binary
still installed fine — install says so and points at the persistent fallback
rather than reporting a failed binary. For a supervisor that SURVIVES session
loss, use --system: it installs a system unit (WantedBy=multi-user.target,
running as you) via sudo. This is also the persistent supervisor for the
connected-projects fleet. On native Windows, install prints Task Scheduler
guidance and exits non-zero until the service is managed by a real install path.
