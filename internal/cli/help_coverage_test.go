// Verb help is the ONLY description of a command an agent can read at runtime
// (sty_a499e7f5). A Short says what the verb is called; the Long has to answer
// the two questions that cost a turn when unanswered — when this verb is the
// right one, and the constraint that is not guessable from the flags.
//
// Two rules, both enforced here so the surface cannot regress the next time a
// command is added:
//
//	presence — every command carries a Long
//	brevity  — that Long stays inside a ceiling, because a help string that
//	           grows into an essay spends the tokens the Short was saving
//
// ENUMERATION RULE, pinned deliberately: group parents ARE included (an agent
// reads `satelle story --help` to choose a verb, so the parent is high-traffic),
// while `completion` (cobra-generated), `help` (cobra's own) and Hidden commands
// are not.
